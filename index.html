    <h1>5 Popular Places To Visit In Greece</h1>
    <p>Known for its plethora of ancient ruins, whitewashed villages, sunny beaches, tasty cuisine and friendly atmosphere, it is no wonder that Greece ranks among Europe’s top travel destinations. But the reason that tourism exists in the first place is that it’s just so beautiful here. Often, you’ll find that beauty on the many scattered islands, lying like little gems in the seas surrounding the Grecian peninsula. Each one offers its own share of stunning landscapes, historic sites, nightlife scenes and cultural delights. <br> <br>There’s a wealth of these to explore. From the Ionian islands in the west – including Kefalonia and Corfu – to the Aegean Sea, boasting Mykonos, Santorini, Kos, and Rhodes, amongst others. Then there’s the pre-Hellenic Minoan culture of Crete to the south. Back on the mainland, there’s scenery worthy of the gods all over the place. The monastery of Meteora, the ruins at Delphi, and then, most famously, the capital of Athens and its iconic Parthenon. Here’s a look at the best places to visit in Greece:</p><br><br>

            Bustling metropolitan cities spread beyond to quiet villages centered around outdoor coffee shops. Steeped in history, Crete still bears archaeological traces of the many civilizations that inhabited it down through the centuries.</p>

          <p>Strung across the Indian Ocean southwest of India and Sri Lanka, the 26 natural atolls of the Maldives exude an almost surreal beauty due, in large part, to the luminous blue waters that surround them. If slipping into the crystal-clear, soul-warming sea is a top criteria for your perfect tropical vacation, this is the place to do it, as water comprises 99 percent of the Maldives. 
              Paradoxically, it also threatens to inundate the shores of this low-lying island nation. </p>

          <p>Bora Bora is the quintessential South Pacific paradise. 
              This lush and dramatically beautiful island in French Polynesia rises to a sharp emerald peak ringed by an azure lagoon. Clusters of coconut palms bristle along the beaches, and luxury bungalows perch over the crystal-clear waters, some with glass floor panels, so you can peer into the thriving sea below.  </p>

          <p>Called the Garden Isle, Kaua'i is a tropical Eden, with lush rainforests, waterfalls, and spectacular green coastal peaks. A natural masterpiece of dramatic lava-sculpted landscapes, the island has a more laid-back vibe than its popular sister islands of Maui and Oahu. Though Kauai is known for being home to one of the rainiest places on earth, the island is comprised of several microclimates, and the area around touristy Poipu tends to be drier.  </p>
